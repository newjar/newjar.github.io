Initially, the UNIX OS used a shell program called **Bourned Shell**. Then eventually, many more shell programs were developed for different flavors of UNIX. The following is brief information about different shells:

+ Sh - Bourne Shell.
+ Csh - C Shell.
+ Ksh - Korn Shell.
+ Tcsh - Enchanced C Shell.
+ Bash - GNU Bourne Again Shell.
+ Zsh - extension to Bash, Ksh, and Tcsh.
+ Pdksh - extension to KSH.

A brief comparison of various shells is presented in the following table:
